      <description>This site took a little while to get up and running, with a few tricks needed here and there, but now that it&amp;rsquo;s all setup, the editing workflow is surprisingly smooth.
First things first, this site is hosted using Hugo, a quick and easy static site generator. I played around with alternatives like Jekyll, Hexo, and even the haskell-based Hakyll, before settling on Hugo almost entirely because of the incredibly fast build times.</description>

      <description>FStitch is a tool developed in the Dowell lab at CU boulder for the analysis of high-throughput genomic sequencing data (GRO-seq). I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on adding small features here and there as well as exploring improvements for more consistent analysis. You can find the original project here, and my development fork here</description>

      <description>This is a small port of Tim Pope&amp;rsquo;s unimpaired.vim, which provides overloading of the square bracket keys to many useful functions. My source, originally pulled from Spacemacs, can be found at zmaas/evil-unimpaired</description>
