## Academic {#academic}

I'm a student of chemistry and mathematics at the University of Colorado: Boulder. Currently I work as an Undergraduate researcher, with a focus on computational biology. I work jointly in the [Taatjes](http://www.colorado.edu/chemistry/taatjeslab/) and [Dowell](http://dowell.colorado.edu/) labs at CU. My work in the Taatjes lab focuses on the analysis of genomic data related to transcriptional pause release, in addition to development and improvement of tools for analysis of high-throughput genetic sequencing data.
