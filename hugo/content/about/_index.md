## Academic {#academic}

I'm a student of chemistry and mathematics at the University of Colorado: Boulder. I work as an Undergraduate researcher in computational biochemistry in the [Taatjes](<http://www.colorado.edu/chemistry/taatjeslab/>) and [Dowell](<http://dowell.colorado.edu/>) labs at CU. In the lab, I'm working on the techniques we use to quantify sequencing data.
