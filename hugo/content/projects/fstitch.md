FStitch is a tool developed in the Dowell lab at CU boulder for the analysis of high-throughput genomic sequencing data (GRO-seq). I've worked on adding small features here and there as well as exploring improvements for more consistent analysis. You can find the original project **[here](https://github.com/azofeifa/FStitch)**, and my development fork **[here](https://github.com/zmaas/FStitch)**
