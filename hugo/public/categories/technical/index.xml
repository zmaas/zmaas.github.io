      <description>This site took a little while to get up and running, with a few tricks needed here and there, but now that it&amp;rsquo;s all setup, the editing workflow is surprisingly smooth.
First things first, this site is hosted using Hugo, a quick and easy static site generator. I played around with alternatives like Jekyll, Hexo, and even the haskell-based Hakyll, before settling on Hugo almost entirely because of the incredibly fast build times.</description>
